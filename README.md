# Around: a React Based Social Network

The website is built based on React, which is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. 
(I found this library is quite powerful and capable of building something that is elegant and neat.)

## Posts
Here in this section, you can upload an image and some comments. Later you can view your post in the "Posts" tab as well as on the map.

## Map
By putting the mouse over the marker, you can see the details about other posts.

## TODO in the future
I haven't got the chance to deal with the backend. I would like to add more functions to this website, such as "View my posts", "Manage my posts", etc. I will keep working on this. But overall, React is a great library!
